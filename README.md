## Features

Tired of having to install several different programs everytime you format or buy a new machine ? New hires on your company are wasting time to get there machines ready to code ?
With faststrap you install the ios environment really easy using just one command.

```shell
faststrap ios -a
```

## Installation

If you are familiar with the command line and Ruby, install `faststrap` yourself:

    sudo gem install faststrap

## Contribute
My goal here is to be the bootstrap platform for several development environments. Install your
dev environment into a machine should be somthing very easy to do.Contributors are more than welcome,please help me to achive this goal. This project is new and still misses lots of things such as:

- Better handling InstallActions order
- Other environments besides ios (Android, Rails, Web, Node)
- Better test coverage
